# Iot-Based_Patient-Health-Monitoring-System-
**Introduction:**

IoT is rapidly revolutionising the Healthcare Industry. In this project, I have designed the IoT
Based Patient Health Monitoring System using **ESP8266 & Arduino**. The IoT platform used
in this project is **ThingSpeak**. This IoT device could read the pulse rate and surrounding
temperature and update them to an IoT platform.
This Health Monitoring System simulates two major aspects of health and wellbeing :
**i) Human Body Temperature, ii) Heart Beat Rate.**
It presents the numerical value of these two aspects and maintains a data logger system
where the patient’s data can be stored and received for medical history and check-up
purpose collectively. Along with that the output values can be viewed through waveform
chart. The circuit output values in the LED represent the current heartbeat, time in second,
heartbeat per minute and body temperature.

**Objectives:**

● To design a portable health monitoring system, which measures the patient’s body
temperature and pulse rate.
● To provide medical assistance according to the data received from the sensors which
stored in cloud server (ThingSpeak).

**Requirements:**

Hardware Requirements-

● Arduino Uno
● ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
● LM35 Temperature Sensor
● Pulse Sensor
● 16*2 LCD Display
● Potentiometer (10K)
● Resistor (1K & 2K)
● Breadboard

Software Requirements-

● Arduino Compiler
● ThingSpeak (Cloud Service)
